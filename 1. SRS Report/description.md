### 1. Introduction
The Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document describes the complete behavior of the system to be developed. It includes both functional and non-functional requirements and serves as a reference throughout the development lifecycle.

### 2. Purpose
To clearly define the functionalities, design constraints, and performance metrics of the system.

### 3. Functional Requirements
- User Registration & Authentication
- Data Input/Upload
- AI/ML Model Integration for Prediction
- Report Generation

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
- Scalability
- Security (e.g., Data Encryption)
- Usability and Accessibility
- Performance (e.g., <1s prediction time)

### 5. System Features
- Dashboard Interface
- Visualization of Results
- Export & Download Options

### 6. Assumptions and Dependencies
- Internet connectivity is required
- Model is pre-trained and updated periodically
