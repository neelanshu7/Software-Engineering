## ðŸŸª Sequence and State Diagrams

**Sequence Diagrams** illustrate how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case, focusing on the order of messages exchanged over time. They show lifelines (participants), messages (interactions), and the sequence of events.


**State Diagrams** model the various states an object can occupy and the transitions between those states, triggered by events. They are valuable for modeling the dynamic behavior of systems, such as lifecycle management or error handling.


| Aspect            | Sequence Diagram               | State Diagram                         |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Focus             | Interactions between objects   | States and transitions of an object   |
| Elements          | Lifelines, messages, fragments| States, transitions, events           |
| Use               | Use case scenarios, workflows | Object behavior, lifecycle modeling   |

> *Sequence diagrams clarify how components collaborate, while state diagrams reveal how an objectâ€™s state changes in response to eventsâ€”both are essential for robust system modeling[11].*
