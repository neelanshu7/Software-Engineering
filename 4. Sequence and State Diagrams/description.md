## 🟪 Sequence and State Diagrams

### 📍 Sequence Diagrams  
**Sequence Diagrams** illustrate how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case, focusing on the **order of messages exchanged over time**.  
They include:
- **Lifelines** (participants)
- **Messages** (interactions)
- **Execution order** of events

### 🔁 State Diagrams  
**State Diagrams** model the various **states an object can occupy** and the **transitions between those states**, triggered by events.  
These diagrams are especially useful for:
- Modeling dynamic behavior
- Lifecycle transitions
- Error handling scenarios

| **Aspect**         | **Sequence Diagram**                  | **State Diagram**                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Focus**          | Interactions between objects           | States and transitions of an object             |
| **Elements**       | Lifelines, messages, fragments         | States, transitions, events                     |
| **Use**            | Use case scenarios, workflows          | Object behavior, lifecycle modeling             |

> 💡 **Insight:**  
> *Sequence diagrams clarify how components collaborate, while state diagrams reveal how an object’s state changes in response to events — both are essential for robust system modeling*.
