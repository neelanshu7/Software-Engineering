## ðŸŸ¨ Class Diagram

A **Class Diagram** is a static structure diagram in UML that models the classes, attributes, methods, and relationships within a software system.  
It provides a blueprint of the system architecture and is crucial for object-oriented design.

### ðŸ§± Main Components:
- **Classes** â€“ Represented as rectangles with three sections: *name*, *attributes*, and *methods*.
- **Attributes** â€“ Variables that hold data for each class.
- **Methods** â€“ Functions or operations performed by the class.

### ðŸ”— Relationships:
- **Association** â€“ Shows how classes are linked.
- **Generalization (Inheritance)** â€“ Indicates a hierarchy between classes.
- **Dependency** â€“ One class relies on another.
- **Aggregation / Composition** â€“ Whole-part relationships.
