## 🟩 Use Case and Activity Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** visually represent the interactions between users (*actors*) and the system, outlining the system's functional requirements.  
Each use case describes a specific function or goal that an actor wants to achieve with the system.

**Activity Diagrams** break down processes into individual actions and decisions, illustrating the flow of activities within a use case or system workflow.  
They are especially useful for visualizing complex processes and identifying potential bottlenecks.

### 📝 Steps to Elaborate a Use Case with an Activity Diagram:
1. **Identify the Use Case:** Define its scope, goals, and involved actors.
2. **Identify Actors and Activities:** List all entities and actions involved.
3. **Start with the Initial Node:** Mark the starting point of the process.
4. **Add Actions and Decision Points:** Represent tasks and branching logic.
5. **Establish Control Flow:** Connect activities and decisions to show sequence and logic.

> **💡 Note:**  
> *Use case and activity diagrams together provide both a high-level overview and a detailed process flow, aiding in requirements analysis and system design.*
