## ðŸŸ© Use Case and Activity Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system, outlining the system's functional requirements. Each use case describes a specific function or goal that an actor wants to achieve with the system[3][5].

**Activity Diagrams** break down processes into individual actions and decisions, illustrating the flow of activities within a use case or system workflow. They are especially useful for visualizing complex processes and identifying potential bottlenecks[4][5].

**Steps to Elaborate a Use Case with an Activity Diagram:**
1. **Identify the Use Case:** Define its scope, goals, and involved actors.
2. **Identify Actors and Activities:** List all entities and actions involved.
3. **Start with the Initial Node:** Mark the starting point of the process.
4. **Add Actions and Decision Points:** Represent tasks and branching logic.
5. **Establish Control Flow:** Connect activities and decisions to show sequence and logic[5].

> *Use case and activity diagrams together provide both a high-level overview and a detailed process flow, aiding in requirements analysis and system design.*

## ðŸŸ¨ Class Diagram

A **Class Diagram** is a static structure diagram in UML that models the classes, attributes, methods, and relationships within a software system. It provides a blueprint of the system architecture and is crucial for object-oriented design[6][7][8][16].

**Main Components:**
- **Classes:** Represented as rectangles with three sections: name, attributes, and methods.
- **Attributes:** Variables that hold data for each class.
- **Methods:** Functions or operations performed by the class.
- **Relationships:**
  - **Association:** Shows how classes are linked.
  - **Generalization (Inheritance):** Indicates a hierarchy between classes.
  - **Dependency:** One class relies on another.
  - **Aggregation/Composition:** Whole-part relationships[7][16][8].
