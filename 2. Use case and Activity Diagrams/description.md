## 🟩 Use Case and Activity Diagrams

**Use Case Diagrams** visually represent the interactions between users (*actors*) and the system, outlining the system's functional requirements.  
Each use case describes a specific function or goal that an actor wants to achieve with the system.

**Activity Diagrams** break down processes into individual actions and decisions, illustrating the flow of activities within a use case or system workflow.  
They are especially useful for visualizing complex processes and identifying potential bottlenecks.

### 📝 Steps to Elaborate a Use Case with an Activity Diagram:
1. **Identify the Use Case:** Define its scope, goals, and involved actors.
2. **Identify Actors and Activities:** List all entities and actions involved.
3. **Start with the Initial Node:** Mark the starting point of the process.
4. **Add Actions and Decision Points:** Represent tasks and branching logic.
5. **Establish Control Flow:** Connect activities and decisions to show sequence and logic.

> **💡 Note:**  
> *Use case and activity diagrams together provide both a high-level overview and a detailed process flow, aiding in requirements analysis and system design.*

## 🟨 Class Diagram

A **Class Diagram** is a static structure diagram in UML that models the classes, attributes, methods, and relationships within a software system.  
It provides a blueprint of the system architecture and is crucial for object-oriented design.

### 🧱 Main Components:
- **Classes** – Represented as rectangles with three sections: *name*, *attributes*, and *methods*.
- **Attributes** – Variables that hold data for each class.
- **Methods** – Functions or operations performed by the class.

### 🔗 Relationships:
- **Association** – Shows how classes are linked.
- **Generalization (Inheritance)** – Indicates a hierarchy between classes.
- **Dependency** – One class relies on another.
- **Aggregation / Composition** – Whole-part relationships.

### 📌 Example (Mermaid Syntax):

\`\`\`mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        +String name
        +String email
        +login()
        +uploadData()
    }

    class Admin {
        +manageUsers()
    }

    class PredictionEngine {
        +loadModel()
        +predict(input)
    }

    class ReportGenerator {
        +generatePDF(result)
    }

    User --> PredictionEngine
    PredictionEngine --> ReportGenerator
    Admin --> User : manages
